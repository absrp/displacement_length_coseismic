<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A set of scripts to analyze the distribution of surface displacements and fracture lengths from coseismic data (surface rupture maps and field displacement measurements) applied here to data from the Landers, Hector Mine, El Mayor-Cucapah, and Ridgecrest earthquakes. 

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This repository contains the scripts and data required to reproduce the results in Rodriguez Padilla and Oskin 202N. 

The data from the Landers, Hector Mine, El Mayor Cucapah, and Ridgecrest (foreshock and mainshock) earthquakes is available in the raw data directory. All figures in the manuscript can be generated using these scripts and data. 

### Prerequisites

The general model described runs on Matlab. All scripts require the Matlab Mapping Toolbox and some functions that are not built in but can be downloaded from Mathworks and are included in the source_code directory so that all code can be run solely by downloading this repository. The specific dependencies for each Matlab script to run are listed at the beginning of the corresponding script.

### Script details

- [ ] Displacement analysis - displacement_analysis.m
- [ ] Fracture length analysis - fracture_length_analysis.m 
- [ ] Fracture length-maximum displacement scaling analysis - scaling_analysis.m
- [ ] Fracture length segmentation simulation - random_sampling.m

Each script is independent of the other ones so there is no need to run them in a specific order.
